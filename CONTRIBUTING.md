# Contriubting

Ideally someday I'd like to move to an [email-centric](https://git-send-email.io/)
workflow, however that is not present at the moment.

If you want to contribute, there are two ways at the moment:

1. You can open an issue on the issue tracker in the format "What? How? Why?",
   together with information about your OS, McEarl version, &c., if needed.
2. Open a pull request while at least roughly trying to follow the code style

Contributions are always welcome :)
