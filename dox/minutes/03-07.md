---
1. I arrived a little later than usual on this Monday morning but I quickly took
   a seat next to my teammates
2. Ms. Zhao was already on our table so she asked me if I wanted to begin our
   longer weekly meeting and I agreed.
3. We sat on a table next to my teammates and began as such:
4. I gave her a brief recap of what I had done since:
	a. I showed her my project plan draft: mostly the phasing
	b. I showed her my user stories in the GitLab "Issues" section
	c. I showed her my twofold C4 diagrams
5. Based on that she mentioned the following:
	a. I needed to start implementating quickly, i.e. it would be advisable
	   to complete my walking skeleton implementation the first sprint
	b. She told me I could include my technology choice in the research
	c. Ms. Zhao also requested me to write up a brief document, explaining
	   the user stories, and to have them structured.
	d. For the C4 diagrams, she mentioned I add actors and supervisor chains
	   for all of the different client types (players, admins, &c.)
6. After that we went into a rather more free-form conversation.
7. From that I mainly gathered:
	a. Think about non-functional requirements
		- how many requests would my program support at once
		- what would be the mean latency
	b. I told her my plans for the foreseeable future, namely:
		- group work
		- finishing my project plan
		- beginning my research document
		- implementation
	c. Finally we also talked a little about the research, noting:
		- technology choice
		- scalability study
8. After that all topics had been exhausted and we bid each other goodbye
9. Fin.
